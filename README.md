# VSCode-Language-FHiCL
 FHiCL language support for Visual Studio Code

## Background 
I'm working on the NOvA experiment at Fermilab, During my MS years at UMD, I have used Atom as my editor on ubuntu instance. After some time I started to hate atom performance and it being electron-based software did not help with that. So I decided to move to VScode for the main development environment that I have a complex integration with my machine on Fermilab. I work regularly on developing code on ART software using C++ and *FHiCL* language which developed as a common language for configuring scientific applications inside many HEP experiments. My friend [Justin's vessel](https://github.com/justinvasel/atom-language-fhicl) developed a syntax package for this language for [Atom](https://github.com/justinvasel/atom-language-fhicl) but with my move to VScode, I wanted something similar. Thanks to Justin for his initiative and continuous support.
